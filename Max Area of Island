# Max Area of Island
# You are given a matrix grid where grid[i] is either a 0 (representing water) or 1 (representing land).

# An island is defined as a group of 1's connected horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

# The area of an island is defined as the number of cells within the island.

# Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If no island exists, return 0.

# Example 1:



# Input: grid = [
#   [0,1,1,0,1],
#   [1,0,1,0,1],
#   [0,1,1,0,1],
#   [0,1,0,0,1]
# ]

# Output: 6
